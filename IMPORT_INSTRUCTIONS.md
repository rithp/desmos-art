# How to Import Your Image into Desmos

##  RECOMMENDED METHOD: Import JSON File

Your image has been converted to **3,354 parametric polynomial equations** and saved in `desmos_state.json`.

### Steps to Import:

1. **Go to Desmos Calculator**
   - Open: https://www.desmos.com/calculator

2. **Open the Menu**
   - Click the **hamburger menu (☰)** in the top-left corner

3. **Import the File**
   - Click **"Import from..."** or **"Load"**
   - Select **"Import from File"**
   - Choose `desmos_state.json` from your files

4. **Wait for Loading**
   - Desmos will load all 3,354 equations automatically
   - This may take 30-60 seconds depending on your computer
   - You should see your anime character appear!

##  What's Included

- **desmos_state.json** - Complete Desmos graph state with all 3,354 parametric curves
- **desmos_output.txt** - Individual equations (if you want to copy-paste specific curves)
- **output.svg** - Vector graphics version (can open in Illustrator, Inkscape, etc.)
- **output.png** - High-resolution PNG (300 DPI)
- **processing_steps.png** - Visualization of the conversion process

##  Important Notes

- **All 3,354 equations are preserved** - No reduction was made
- The equations are in parametric form: (x(t), y(t)) where t ranges from 0 to 1
- Each curve is a 4th-degree polynomial
- If Desmos is slow to load, try:
  - Using a desktop browser (Chrome/Firefox) instead of mobile
  - Closing other browser tabs
  - Waiting patiently - it WILL load!

##  Alternative Uses

If you don't need Desmos specifically:

- **SVG (output.svg)**: Open in web browsers, Illustrator, Inkscape, or any vector editor
- **PNG (output.png)**: High-resolution image at 300 DPI
- Can be used in presentations, printed, or further edited
